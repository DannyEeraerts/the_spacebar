             Fast meteors can leave glowing "trains" (incandescent bits of debris in the wake of the meteor)
              which last for several seconds to minutes. In general, 30 Eta Aquarid meteors can be seen 
              per hour during their peak.',

            These faint meteors are difficult to spot, and if there is a moon you will not be able to 
            view them. If the moon is not present, your best chance to see the Delta Aquariids is when 
            meteor rates rise during the shower\'s peak at the end of July.'];
